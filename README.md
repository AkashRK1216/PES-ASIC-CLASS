# PES-ASIC-CLASS
This is my github repo for ASIC classes

<p>ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Chip Design and is an integral part of our daily lives.
This course covers key aspects of RISC-V and chip design, spanning design cycles, RISC-V ISA, analog IPs, and mixed-signal flow. It delves into process design kits, libraries, RTL design synthesis, and gate-level simulation. The curriculum also includes RTL-to-GDS flow, encompassing SoC design implementation from floor planning to post-layout timing analysis.</p>

<h1>DAY 1:</h1>

  <p>1)we learn how to type and execute a c code in the linux terminal

 <p>2) we learn to break down the C code into assembly code:

here is the assembly version of only the main() part of the C program:

<p>This concludes day 1.</p>

<h1>DAY 2:</h1>
<p>An Application Binary Interface (ABI) defines how binary code interacts at a low level, specifying data structures, calling conventions, and system-level details to ensure compatibility between compiled software components on a given platform.

Application software -(API)-> Standard Libraries -> OS -(ISA)-> Processor Architecture -(RTL)-> Hardware
API - Application Programming Interface
ISA - Intruction Set Architecture
RTL - Register transfer level</p>
<p>In the below code, we write a C program that iterates from 1 to n and finds the sum</p>
