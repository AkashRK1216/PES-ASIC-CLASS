# PES-ASIC-CLASS
This is my github repo for ASIC classes

ASIC means Application Specific Integrated Chip Design and this field is an integral part of our daily lives.
In this lab we cover a number of key concepts related to ASICs
In the first lab:
  1)we learn how to type and execute a c code in the linux terminal

  2) we learn to break down the C code into assembly code:

    here is the assembly version of only the main() part of the C program:
